## Description
Created a React Todo app which has all the CRUD functionalities.

## Features
1. The Todo app includes a task name, description, and status.
2. By default, the status will be "Not Completed".
3. Each todo card has two buttons: "Edit" and "Delete" to perform update and delete operations.
4. Each todo card has a dropdown for status with options "Completed" and "Not Completed". By clicking on it, we can change the status of the todo.
5. There is a status filter to display the todo cards based on their status: "Completed", "Not Completed", or "All".

## Functionalities Used
For this React Todo app, I have used `useState` for implementing the CRUD functionalities.
